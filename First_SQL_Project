-- DATA extracted from Kaggle, 'Predicting Employee Attrition'
-- DATA retrieved on 6/12/2022



-- Below I began by creating a table with the values from the CVS file, and I imported into PgAdmin

CREATE TABLE sample3(
Emp_ID INTEGER,
Date_Record	TIMESTAMP,
Age INTEGER,
Gender VARCHAR(10),
City VARCHAR(5),
Education_Level VARCHAR (10),
Salary BIGINT,
Date_Of_Joining TIMESTAMP,
Last_WorkingDate TIMESTAMP,
Joining_Designation	INTEGER,
Designation	INTEGER,
Total_Business_Value BIGINT,	
Quarterly_Rating INTEGER
)



-- Cleaning up data because there are duplicate employee ID rows



SELECT COUNT(emp_id) FROM sample3;
-- There are 19104 records of employee ID


SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT emp_id) FROM sample3; 
-- There are actually 2,381 employees in this dataset 



DELETE FROM sample3 WHERE emp_id IN(
SELECT emp_id FROM
(SELECT emp_id, 
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY emp_id ORDER BY date_record DESC) AS row_num
FROM sample3)
A WHERE row_num> 1); 
-- Removed duplicate files employee IDs
-- This part was hard to work around because I wanted to keep latest 'last_workingdate' where employees quit
-- Result of the code ended with more of my sample getting removed 
-- Open for feedbacks around this coding





SELECT ROUND(avg(salary),2) FROM sample3 
-- Average salary $49,901.60


-- Examining high earners 
WITH temporaryTable(averageValue) AS
(SELECT avg(salary) FROM sample3)
SELECT emp_id, salary, last_workingdate

-- 88 employees make above the average 
 
SELECT COUNT(last_workingdate) FROM sample3
WHERE salary > 49901.60; 
-- 36/88=40.90% employees left making above average 

SELECT gender, COUNT(gender) FROM sample3
WHERE salary > 49901.60
GROUP BY gender; 
-- Ratio of 50:38, men to women making above average


-- Examining low earners 
WITH temporaryTable(averageValue) AS
(SELECT avg(salary) FROM sample3)
SELECT emp_id, salary, last_workingdate
FROM sample3, temporaryTable
WHERE salary < temporaryTable.averageValue; 
-- 93 employees make less than the average 


SELECT COUNT(last_workingdate) FROM sample3
WHERE salary < 49901.60;
-- 66/93=70.96% employees left making below average 


SELECT gender, COUNT(gender) FROM sample3
WHERE salary < 49901.60
GROUP BY gender; 
-- 60:33 men to women ratio making below average 

-- Exploring education level 
SELECT education_level, COUNT(education_level) FROM sample3
GROUP BY education_level; 
-- Bachelor (57), Master (55), College (69)

WITH tempTable(avgValues) AS 
(SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary),2) FROM sample3)
SELECT COUNT(education_level)

WHERE salary > tempTable.avgValues AND education_level = 'Bachelor'; 
-- 25/57 (43.86%) holding a Bachelors degree make > avg 

WITH tempTable(avgValues) AS

SELECT COUNT(education_level)
FROM sample3, tempTable
WHERE salary > tempTable.avgValues AND education_level = 'Master';

-- 29/69 (36.23%) holding a College degree make > avg




-- Conclusions:
-- Employees making above avg are likely to stay (40.90% v. 70.96%)
-- Women earning above avg is > than below avg earners (43.18% v. 35.48%)
-- Men earning above avg is < than below avg earners (56.81% v. 64.51%)
