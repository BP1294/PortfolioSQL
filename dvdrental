-- For the following cases, I was exploring the dataset called 'DVDrental'


-- Looking for top performer. Which of the staff sold the most? 

/* 
SELECT staff.staff_id, staff.first_name, staff.last_name, SUM(payment.amount) AS total_sales 
FROM staff
JOIN payment
ON staff.staff_id = payment.staff_id
GROUP BY staff.staff_id
ORDER BY SUM(payment.amount) DESC; 
*/

-- In the results, we find that Jon Stephens sold over $31,059.92 while Mike Hillyer made of $30,252.12 --





-- Looking at top paying customer

/*

GROUP BY customer.first_name, customer.last_name
ORDER BY SUM(payment.amount) DESC;
*/

ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
GROUP BY address.district
ORDER BY SUM(payment.amount) DESC;
*/

-- Exploring top sales per month, dataset contains only from February 2007 to May 2007 
-- payment_date originally coded as a TIMESTAMP,  EXTRACT() was used to get Month in order

EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date) AS month,
SUM(payment.amount) as total_sales
FROM staff
JOIN payment
ON staff.staff_id = payment.staff_id
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM payment_date)
ORDER BY SUM(payment.amount) DESC;
*/
